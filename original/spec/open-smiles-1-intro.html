<a name="1.1"></a><h3>1.1 Purpose</h3>


<p>This document formally defines an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_specifications">open specification</a> version of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular_input_line_entry_specification">SMILES</a>
language, a typographical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_notation">line notation</a>
for specifying chemical structure.  It is hosted under the banner of the
<a href="http://blueobelisk.sourceforge.net">Blue Obelisk</a>
project, with the intent to solicit contributions and comments from the
entire computational chemistry community.</p>


<a name="1.2"></a><h3>1.2 Motivation</h3>

<p>SMILES was originally developed as a proprietary specification by <a href="http://www.daylight.com">Daylight
Chemical Information Systems</a>.  Since the introduction of SMILES in the late 1980's, it has
become widely accepted as a defacto standard for exchange of molecular structures.  Many independent
SMILES software packages have been written in C, C++, Java, Python, LISP, and probably even
FORTRAN.</p>

<p>At this point in the history of SMILES, is appropriate for the chemistry community
to develop a new, non-proprietary specification for the SMILES language.  Daylight's
<a href="http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smiles.html">SMILES Theory
Manual</a> has long been the "gold standard" for the SMILES language, but as a
proprietary specification, it limits the universal adoption of SMILES, and has no
mechanism for contributions from the chemistry community.  We salute Daylight for
their past contributions, and the excellent SMILES documentation they provided free
of charge for the past two decades.</p>

<a name="1.3"></a><h3>1.3 Audience</h3>

<p>This document is intended for developers designing or improving a SMILES
parser or writer. <b>Readers are expected to be acquainted with
SMILES.</b> Due to the formality of this document, it is not a good
tutorial for those trying to learn SMILES. This document is written with
<i>precision</i> as the primary goal; <i>readability</i> is secondary.</p>

<a name="1.4"></a><h3>1.4 What is a Molecule? The Valence Model of Chemistry</h3>

<p>Before defining the SMILES language, it is important to state the physical model on which it is
based: the valence model of chemistry, which uses a mathematician's
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28mathematics%29">graph</a> to
represent a molecule.  In a chemical graph, the <i>nodes</i>
are atoms, and the <i>edges</i> are semi-rigid bonds that can be single, double, or
triple according to the rules of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_bond_theory">valence bond theory</a>.</p>

<p>This simple mental model has little resemblance to the underlying quantum-mechanical reality of
electrons, protons and neutrons, yet it has proved to be a remarkably useful approximation of how
atoms behave in close proximity to one another.  However, the valence model is an imperfect
representation of molecular structure, and the SMILES language inherits these imperfections.
Chemical bonds are often tautomeric, aromatic or otherwise fractional rather than neat integer
multiples.  Delocalized bonds, bond-centered bonds, hydrogen bonds and various other inter-atom
forces that are well characterized by a quantum-mechanics description simply don't fit into the
valence model.</p>

<p>McLeod and Peter's quip captures the deficiencies of SMILES well: if you
<i>can't</i> build a molecule from a modeling kit, the deficiencies of SMILES and other
connection-table formats become apparent.</p>
